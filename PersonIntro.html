	<h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
    1.  My favorite culture that I am not native to is Norwegian, I like the general modesty and emphasis on 
		civic engagement. Their cultural foods aren't terribly complicated, which I find appealing.
		<br><br>
	2.  One of the historical figures that I relate to is Benjamin Franklin, because he was so dedicated to 
		his passion projects, namely developing uses for this party novelty of generating electricity and 
		the American Revolution. Not a historical figure, but one character I relate to is Justy Ueki Tylor.
		His unconventional way of recognizing situations for what they are and general philosophy of "come what may 
		and love your friends" pulled me out of a pretty serious depressive funk.
		<br><br>
	3.  I'd say a meal that represents me is gas station pizza, because I spent 3 years as the pizza chef 
		for my local Caseys.
		<br><br>
	4.  I feel most creative after 8pm, when I start to unwind before bedtime.
